    <h2>About Noordolal (Noor Dolal)</h2>
    <p>Noordolal, also spelled Noor Dolal (Urdu: نوردولال), is one of the oldest villages in Gujar Khan Tehsil, Rawalpindi District, Punjab, Pakistan. Located 40 km southeast of Rawalpindi, it was once a bustling hub for the local community, serving as a central point for shopping and social activities. The village had several grocery shops, a Jamia Masjid, boys’ and girls’ schools, and a post office.</p>
    <p>Noordolal is the main village surrounded by smaller settlements, including Bunmera (also known as Dhoke Major after Major M. Anwer Qureshi of Bunmera), Dhoke Aarra, Dhoke Gumti, Dhoke Gurrah, Dhoke Mir Afzal Shaheed, and Dhoke Lamian.</p>
    <p>The area has important educational institutions such as a girls’ middle school in Dhoke Qureshian (Dhoke Lamian) and a boys’ middle school in Noor Dolal — both established on land donated by Maj. M. Anwar Qureshi. The village also hosts the Basic Health Unit for the Union Council, located at Ghousia Chowk, which serves as the main shopping centre for Noordolal.</p>
